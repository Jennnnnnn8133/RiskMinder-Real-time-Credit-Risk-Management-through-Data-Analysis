# RiskMinder: Real-time-Credit-Risk-Management-through-Data

Credits Risk Analysis: 
The objective of this case study is to help a leading bank predict which customers are most likely to default on a loan. To achieve this, the bank wants to analyze the behavior of existing customers in order to make informed decisions on whether to extend credit to new customers. Credit scoring is the set of decision models and techniques that aid lenders in granting consumer credit, and this project will utilize various credit scoring techniques to achieve the desired outcome. By analyzing data related to credit cards, auto loans, home loans, and other personal loan products, the bank can identify patterns and trends that indicate higher risk of default. This will enable the bank to make more informed decisions about extending credit to new customers and minimize the risk of default.

Objectives:
- The objective of the case study is to help a leading bank predict customers who are most likely to default on a loan.

- The bank wants to analyze the behavior of existing customers to make decisions on whether to extend credit to new customers.

- Credit scoring techniques will be used to achieve this objective.

- Data related to various loan products, including credit cards, auto loans, home loans, and personal loans, will be analyzed to identify patterns and trends indicating a higher risk of default.

- The ultimate goal is to enable the bank to make more informed decisions about extending credit to new customers and minimize the risk of default.

An ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of a classification model's performance at all classification thresholds. It shows the trade-off between the sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model at different thresholds.

To find the best cutoff point, we need to identify the point on the ROC curve that maximizes the model's sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. This point is often referred to as the "optimal threshold" or "cutoff point". At this point, the model's performance is considered to be the best in terms of correctly identifying both positive and negative cases.

Choosing a threshold that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity helps to minimize bias towards either positives or negatives, leading to a more balanced and accurate classification model. While this threshold may not always provide the highest prediction in the model, it ensures that the model is performing at its best across all possible classification thresholds.
